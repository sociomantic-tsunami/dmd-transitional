Subject: [PATCH 05/21] =?UTF-8?q?Replace=20UTF-8=E2=80=93invalid=20embedde?=
 =?UTF-8?q?d=20characters=20with=20valid=20UTF-8?=
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The copyright symbol, when encoded in Win-1252, is not valid UTF-8. D assumes UTF-8 and chokes on it, so this commit replaces it with the valid, multibyte UTF-8 encoding of the symbol.

Note: I feel it would be safer to simply use "(C)", as is used everywhere else in the code, but that would seem to ignore the intentions of the original author.
